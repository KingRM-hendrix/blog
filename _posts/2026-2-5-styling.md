This part is when I started to have issues. Though switching the title and date as well as the page adding was easy. I had an unnecissarily hard time trying to figure out how to apply CSS to the website. It fustrates me when I add a format to a class only to end up not working. I was only capable of changing the footer, and I still don't understand why any other aspect of this site does not change. Looking forward to advice on how to make this easier on me because I might've lost some sleep.

As expected, I can do more than just links.
