Despite being my first time in web design, it seemed very easy for me in creating this blog, despite being entirely new to me. The only part I struggled with is installing the bundles because Ruby 4.0 does not work with it. It would be nice to learn a bit more about the formating. Regardless, I'm glad I'm able to make this and I look forward to what comes next!

Here's the Computer Science classes I take by the way.

* [Database & Web Systems][web-design]
* [Computing Systems][computational]
* [Discrete Math][discrete]
