There's an extensive list of games I've played throughout the years, and I would like to talk about some of my favorites.

Minecraft is a great game to play with friends. The use of mods makes the game a versatile experience for everyone. I hope to play survival multiplayer with others sometime.

The Legend of Zelda is a also a good series. Though my best is Ocarina of Time because it's easy to get into, and Breath of the Wild for its open world gameplay, I appreciate Twilight Princess's use of sword skills and I really want to see that mechanic come back in their games again.

Deltarune is also a game that breaks my expectations and shocked me in one of its endings. Although it's halfway finished, I have been moved by it and so have others. I hope to see the other half of the game coming out in 2026.

Castlevania is also another favorite of mine with the great soundtrack that comes along with it. I wished Konami made a game that covers the fictional events of what happened in 1999 though.
